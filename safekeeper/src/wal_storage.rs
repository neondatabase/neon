//! This module has everything to deal with WAL -- reading and writing to disk.
//!
//! Safekeeper WAL is stored in the timeline directory, in format similar to pg_wal.
//! PG timeline is always 1, so WAL segments are usually have names like this:
//! - 000000010000000000000001
//! - 000000010000000000000002.partial
//!
//! Note that last file has `.partial` suffix, that's different from postgres.
