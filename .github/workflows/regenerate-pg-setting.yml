          message: |
            If this PR added a GUC in the Postgres fork or `neon` extension,
            please regenerate the Postgres settings in the `cloud` repo:

            ```
            make NEON_WORKDIR=path/to/neon/checkout \
              -C goapp/internal/shareddomain/postgres generate
            ```

            If you're an external contributor, a Neon employee will assist in
            making sure this step is done.
