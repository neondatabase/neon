//!
//! Utilities for reading and writing the PostgreSQL control file.
//!
//! The PostgreSQL control file is one the first things that the PostgreSQL
//! server reads when it starts up. It indicates whether the server was shut
//! down cleanly, or if it crashed or was restored from online backup so that
//! WAL recovery needs to be performed. It also contains a copy of the latest
//! checkpoint record and its location in the WAL.
//!
//! The control file also contains fields for detecting whether the
//! data directory is compatible with a postgres binary. That includes
//! a version number, configuration options that can be set at
//! compilation time like the block size, and the platform's alignment
//! and endianness information. (The PostgreSQL on-disk file format is
//! not portable across platforms.)
//!
//! The control file is stored in the PostgreSQL data directory, as
//! `global/pg_control`. The data stored in it is designed to be smaller than
//! 512 bytes, on the assumption that it can be updated atomically. The actual
//! file is larger, 8192 bytes, but the rest of it is just filled with zeros.
//!
//! See src/include/catalog/pg_control.h in the PostgreSQL sources for more
//! information. You can use PostgreSQL's pg_controldata utility to view its
//! contents.
