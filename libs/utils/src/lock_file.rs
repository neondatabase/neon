//! A module to create and read lock files.
//!
//! File locking is done using [`fcntl::flock`] exclusive locks.
//! The only consumer of this module is currently
//! [`pid_file`](crate::pid_file). See the module-level comment
//! there for potential pitfalls with lock files that are used
//! to store PIDs (pidfiles).
