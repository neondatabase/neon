//! Types representing protocols and actual agent-monitor messages.
//!
//! The pervasive use of serde modifiers throughout this module is to ease
//! serialization on the go side. Because go does not have enums (which model
//! messages well), it is harder to model messages, and we accomodate that with
//! serde.
//!
//! *Note*: the agent sends and receives messages in different ways.
//!
//! The agent serializes messages in the form and then sends them. The use
//! of `#[serde(tag = "type", content = "content")]` allows us to use `Type`
//! to determine how to deserialize `Content`.
//! ```ignore
//! struct {
//!     Content any
//!     Type    string
//!     Id      uint64
//! }
//! ```
//! and receives messages in the form:
//! ```ignore
//! struct {
//!     {fields embedded}
//!     Type string
//!     Id   uint64
//! }
//! ```
//! After reading the type field, the agent will decode the entire message
//! again, this time into the correct type using the embedded fields.
//! Because the agent cannot just extract the json contained in a certain field
//! (it initially deserializes to `map[string]interface{}`), we keep the fields
//! at the top level, so the entire piece of json can be deserialized into a struct,
//! such as a `DownscaleResult`, with the `Type` and `Id` fields ignored.
