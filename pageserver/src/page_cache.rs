//!
//! Global page cache
//!
//! The page cache uses up most of the memory in the page server. It is shared
//! by all tenants, and it is used to store different kinds of pages. Sharing
//! the cache allows memory to be dynamically allocated where it's needed the
//! most.
//!
//! The page cache consists of fixed-size buffers, 8 kB each to match the
//! PostgreSQL buffer size, and a Slot struct for each buffer to contain
//! information about what's stored in the buffer.
//!
//! # Types Of Pages
//!
//! [`PageCache`] only supports immutable pages.
//! Hence there is no need to worry about coherency.
//!
//! Two types of pages are supported:
//!
//! * **Materialized pages**, filled & used by page reconstruction
//! * **Immutable File pages**, filled & used by [`crate::tenant::block_io`] and [`crate::tenant::ephemeral_file`].
//!
//! Note that [`crate::tenant::ephemeral_file::EphemeralFile`] is generally mutable, but, it's append-only.
//! It uses the page cache only for the blocks that are already fully written and immutable.
//!
//! # Filling The Page Cache
//!
//! Page cache maps from a cache key to a buffer slot.
//! The cache key uniquely identifies the piece of data that is being cached.
//!
//! The cache key for **materialized pages** is  [`TenantId`], [`TimelineId`], [`Key`], and [`Lsn`].
//! Use [`PageCache::memorize_materialized_page`] and [`PageCache::lookup_materialized_page`] for fill & access.
//!
//! The cache key for **immutable file** pages is [`FileId`] and a block number.
//! Users of page cache that wish to page-cache an arbitrary (immutable!) on-disk file do the following:
//! * Have a mechanism to deterministically associate the on-disk file with a [`FileId`].
//! * Get a [`FileId`] using [`next_file_id`].
//! * Use the mechanism to associate the on-disk file with the returned [`FileId`].
//! * Use [`PageCache::read_immutable_buf`] to get a [`ReadBufResult`].
//! * If the page was already cached, it'll be the [`ReadBufResult::Found`] variant that contains
//!   a read guard for the page. Just use it.
//! * If the page was not cached, it'll be the [`ReadBufResult::NotFound`] variant that contains
//!   a write guard for the page. Fill the page with the contents of the on-disk file.
//!   Then call [`PageWriteGuard::mark_valid`] to mark the page as valid.
//!   Then try again to [`PageCache::read_immutable_buf`].
//!   Unless there's high cache pressure, the page should now be cached.
//!   (TODO: allow downgrading the write guard to a read guard to ensure forward progress.)
//!
//! # Locking
//!
//! There are two levels of locking involved: There's one lock for the "mapping"
//! from page identifier (tenant ID, timeline ID, rel, block, LSN) to the buffer
//! slot, and a separate lock on each slot. To read or write the contents of a
//! slot, you must hold the lock on the slot in read or write mode,
//! respectively. To change the mapping of a slot, i.e. to evict a page or to
//! assign a buffer for a page, you must hold the mapping lock and the lock on
//! the slot at the same time.
//!
//! Whenever you need to hold both locks simultaneously, the slot lock must be
//! acquired first. This consistent ordering avoids deadlocks. To look up a page
//! in the cache, you would first look up the mapping, while holding the mapping
//! lock, and then lock the slot. You must release the mapping lock in between,
//! to obey the lock ordering and avoid deadlock.
//!
//! A slot can momentarily have invalid contents, even if it's already been
//! inserted to the mapping, but you must hold the write-lock on the slot until
//! the contents are valid. If you need to release the lock without initializing
//! the contents, you must remove the mapping first. We make that easy for the
//! callers with PageWriteGuard: when lock_for_write() returns an uninitialized
//! page, the caller must explicitly call guard.mark_valid() after it has
//! initialized it. If the guard is dropped without calling mark_valid(), the
//! mapping is automatically removed and the slot is marked free.
//!
