//!
//! Global page cache
//!
//! The page cache uses up most of the memory in the page server. It is shared
//! by all tenants, and it is used to store different kinds of pages. Sharing
//! the cache allows memory to be dynamically allocated where it's needed the
//! most.
//!
//! The page cache consists of fixed-size buffers, 8 kB each to match the
//! PostgreSQL buffer size, and a Slot struct for each buffer to contain
//! information about what's stored in the buffer.
//!
//! # Locking
//!
//! There are two levels of locking involved: There's one lock for the "mapping"
//! from page identifier (tenant ID, timeline ID, rel, block, LSN) to the buffer
//! slot, and a separate lock on each slot. To read or write the contents of a
//! slot, you must hold the lock on the slot in read or write mode,
//! respectively. To change the mapping of a slot, i.e. to evict a page or to
//! assign a buffer for a page, you must hold the mapping lock and the lock on
//! the slot at the same time.
//!
//! Whenever you need to hold both locks simultenously, the slot lock must be
//! acquired first. This consistent ordering avoids deadlocks. To look up a page
//! in the cache, you would first look up the mapping, while holding the mapping
//! lock, and then lock the slot. You must release the mapping lock in between,
//! to obey the lock ordering and avoid deadlock.
//!
//! A slot can momentarily have invalid contents, even if it's already been
//! inserted to the mapping, but you must hold the write-lock on the slot until
//! the contents are valid. If you need to release the lock without initializing
//! the contents, you must remove the mapping first. We make that easy for the
//! callers with PageWriteGuard: when lock_for_write() returns an uninitialized
//! page, the caller must explicitly call guard.mark_valid() after it has
//! initialized it. If the guard is dropped without calling mark_valid(), the
//! mapping is automatically removed and the slot is marked free.
//!
