// TODO: configurable for how long to wait before executing deletions

/// We aggregate object deletions from many tenants in one place, for several reasons:
/// - Coalesce deletions into fewer DeleteObjects calls
/// - Enable Tenant/Timeline lifetimes to be shorter than the time it takes
///   to flush any outstanding deletions.
/// - Globally control throughput of deletions, as these are a low priority task: do
///   not compete with the same S3 clients/connections used for higher priority uploads.
/// - Enable gating deletions on validation of a tenant's generation number, to make
///   it safe to multi-attach tenants (see docs/rfcs/025-generation-numbers.md)
///
/// There are two kinds of deletion: deferred and immediate.  A deferred deletion
/// may be intentionally delayed to protect passive readers of S3 data, and is
/// subject to a generation number validation step.  An immediate deletion is
/// ready to execute immediately, and is only queued up so that it can be coalesced
/// with other deletions in flight.
///
/// Deferred deletions pass through three steps:
/// - ListWriter: accumulate deletion requests from Timelines, and batch them up into
///   DeletionLists, which are persisted to disk.
/// - Validator: accumulate deletion lists, and validate them en-masse prior to passing
///   the keys in the list onward for actual deletion.  Also validate remote_consistent_lsn
///   updates for running timelines.
/// - Deleter: accumulate object keys that the validator has validated, and execute them in
///   batches of 1000 keys via DeleteObjects.
///
/// Non-deferred deletions, such as during timeline deletion, bypass the first
/// two stages and are passed straight into the Deleter.
///
/// Internally, each stage is joined by a channel to the next.  On disk, there is only
/// one queue (of DeletionLists), which is written by the frontend and consumed
/// by the backend.
