//! This module implements the pageserver-global disk-usage-based layer eviction task.
//!
//! # Mechanics
//!
//! Function `launch_disk_usage_global_eviction_task` starts a pageserver-global background
//! loop that evicts layers in response to a shortage of available bytes
//! in the $repo/tenants directory's filesystem.
//!
//! The loop runs periodically at a configurable `period`.
//!
//! Each loop iteration uses `statvfs` to determine filesystem-level space usage.
//! It compares the returned usage data against two different types of thresholds.
//! The iteration tries to evict layers until app-internal accounting says we should be below the thresholds.
//! We cross-check this internal accounting with the real world by making another `statvfs` at the end of the iteration.
//! We're good if that second statvfs shows that we're _actually_ below the configured thresholds.
//! If we're still above one or more thresholds, we emit a warning log message, leaving it to the operator to investigate further.
//!
//! # Eviction Policy
//!
//! There are two thresholds:
//! `max_usage_pct` is the relative available space, expressed in percent of the total filesystem space.
//! If the actual usage is higher, the threshold is exceeded.
//! `min_avail_bytes` is the absolute available space in bytes.
//! If the actual usage is lower, the threshold is exceeded.
//! If either of these thresholds is exceeded, the system is considered to have "disk pressure", and eviction
//! is performed on the next iteration, to release disk space and bring the usage below the thresholds again.
//! The iteration evicts layers in LRU fashion, but, with a weak reservation per tenant.
//! The reservation is to keep the most recently accessed X bytes per tenant resident.
//! If we cannot relieve pressure by evicting layers outside of the reservation, we
//! start evicting layers that are part of the reservation, LRU first.
//!
//! The value for the per-tenant reservation is referred to as `tenant_min_resident_size`
//! throughout the code, but, no actual variable carries that name.
//! The per-tenant default value is the `max(tenant's layer file sizes, regardless of local or remote)`.
//! The idea is to allow at least one layer to be resident per tenant, to ensure it can make forward progress
//! during page reconstruction.
//! An alternative default for all tenants can be specified in the `tenant_config` section of the config.
//! Lastly, each tenant can have an override in their respective tenant config (`min_resident_size_override`).

// Implementation notes:
// - The `#[allow(dead_code)]` above various structs are to suppress warnings about only the Debug impl
//   reading these fields. We use the Debug impl for semi-structured logging, though.
