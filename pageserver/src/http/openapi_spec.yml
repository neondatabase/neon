      description: |
        Configures a _tenant location_, that is how a particular pageserver handles
        a particular tenant.  This includes _attached_ tenants, i.e. those ingesting WAL
        and page service requests, and _secondary_ tenants, i.e. those which are just keeping
        a warm cache in anticipation of transitioning to attached state in the future.

        This is a declarative, idempotent API: there are not separate endpoints
        for different tenant location configurations.  Rather, this single endpoint accepts
        a description of the desired location configuration, and makes whatever changes
        are required to reach that state.

        In imperative terms, this API is used to attach and detach tenants, and
        to transition tenants to and from secondary mode.

        This is a synchronous API: there is no 202 response.  State transitions should always
        be fast (milliseconds), with the exception of requests setting `flush_ms`, in which case
        the caller controls the runtime of the request.

        In some state transitions, it makes sense to flush dirty data to remote storage: this includes transitions
        to AttachedStale and Detached.  Flushing is never necessary for correctness, but is an
        important optimization when doing migrations.  The `flush_ms` parameter controls whether
        flushing should be attempted, and how much time is allowed for flushing.  If the time limit expires,
        the requested transition will continue without waiting for any outstanding data to flush.  Callers
        should use a duration which is substantially less than their HTTP client's request
        timeout.  It is safe to supply flush_ms irrespective of the request body: in state transitions
        where flushing doesn't make sense, the server will ignore it.

        It is safe to retry requests, but if one receives a 409 or 503 response, it is not
        useful to retry aggressively: there is probably an existing request still ongoing.

        Create a timeline. Returns new timeline id on success.
        Recreating the same timeline will succeed if the parameters match the existing timeline.
        If no pg_version is specified, assume DEFAULT_PG_VERSION hardcoded in the pageserver.

        To ensure durability, the caller must retry the creation until success.
        Just because the timeline is visible via other endpoints does not mean it is durable.
        Future versions may stop showing timelines that are not yet durable.

            - `maybe` means almost nothing, don't read anything into it
              except for the fact that the pageserver _might_ be already
              writing to the tenant's S3 state, so, DO NOT ATTACH the
              tenant to any other pageserver, or we risk split-brain.
            - `attached` means that the attach operation has completed,
              successfully
            - `failed` means that attach has failed. For reason check corresponding `reason` failed.
              `failed` is the terminal state, retrying attach call wont resolve the issue.
              For example this can be caused by s3 being unreachable. The retry may be implemented
              with call to detach, though it would be better to not automate it and inspec failed state
              manually before proceeding with a retry.
