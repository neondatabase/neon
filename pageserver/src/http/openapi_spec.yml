        Schedules attach operation to happen in the background for the given tenant.
        As soon as the caller sends this request, it must assume the pageserver
        starts writing to the tenant's S3 state unless it receives one of the
        distinguished errors below that state otherwise.

        If a client receives a not-distinguished response, e.g., a network timeout,
        it MUST retry the /attach request and poll again for the tenant's
        attachment status.

        After the client has received a 202, it MUST poll the tenant's
        attachment status (field `attachment_status`) to reach state `attached`.
        If the `attachment_status` is missing, the client MUST retry the `/attach`
        request (goto previous paragraph). This is a robustness measure in case the tenant
        status endpoint is buggy, but the attach operation is ongoing.

        There is no way to cancel an in-flight request.

        In any case, the client
        * MUST NOT ASSUME that the /attach request has been lost in the network,
        * MUST NOT ASSUME that the request has been lost, based on the observation
          that a subsequent tenant status request returns 404. The request may
          still be in flight. It must be retried.

        The client SHOULD supply a `TenantConfig` for the tenant in the request body.
        Settings specified in the config override the pageserver's defaults.
        It is guaranteed that the config settings are applied before the pageserver
        starts operating on the tenant. E.g., if the config specifies a specific
        PITR interval for a tenant, then that setting will be in effect before the
        pageserver starts the garbage collection loop. This enables a client to
        guarantee a specific PITR setting across detach/attach cycles.
        The pageserver will reject the request if it cannot parse the config, or
        if there are any unknown fields in it.

        If the client does not supply a config, the pageserver will use its defaults.
        This behavior is deprecated: https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/issues/4282

        Remove tenant data (including all corresponding timelines) from pageserver's memory.
        Files on local disk and remote storage are not affected.

        Future pageserver restarts won't load the data back until `load` is called on such tenant.

        Schedules an operation that attempts to load a tenant from the local disk and
        synchronise it with the remote storage (if enabled), repeating pageserver's restart logic for tenant load.
        If the tenant was ignored before, removes the ignore mark and continues with load scheduling.

        Errors if the tenant is absent on disk, already present in memory or fails to schedule its load.
        Scheduling a load does not mean that the tenant would load successfully, check tenant status to ensure load correctness.

            - `maybe` means almost nothing, don't read anything into it
              except for the fact that the pageserver _might_ be already
              writing to the tenant's S3 state, so, DO NOT ATTACH the
              tenant to any other pageserver, or we risk split-brain.
            - `attached` means that the attach operation has completed,
              successfully
            - `failed` means that attach has failed. For reason check corresponding `reason` failed.
              `failed` is the terminal state, retrying attach call wont resolve the issue.
              For example this can be caused by s3 being unreachable. The retry may be implemented
              with call to detach, though it would be better to not automate it and inspec failed state
              manually before proceeding with a retry.

            See the tenant `/attach` endpoint for more information.
