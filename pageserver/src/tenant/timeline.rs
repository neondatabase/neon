        // key space into roughly fixed-size chunks, but also take into
        // account any existing image layers, and try to align the
        // chunk boundaries with the existing image layers to avoid
        // too much churn. Also try to align chunk boundaries with
        // relation boundaries.  In principle, we don't know about

        // pairs, and the code in pgdatadir_mapping.rs knows how to
        // map relations into key-value pairs. But in practice we know

        // identify a relation. This is just an optimization,
        // though.

        // 2. Once we know the partitioning, for each partition,
        // decide if it's time to create a new image layer. The
        // criteria is: there has been too much "churn" since the last
        // image layer? The "churn" is fuzzy concept, it's a
        // combination of too many delta files, or too much WAL in
        // total in the delta file. Or perhaps: if creating an image
        // file would allow to delete some older files.
