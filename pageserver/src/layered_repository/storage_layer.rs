/// Struct used to communicate across calls to 'get_value_reconstruct_data'.

/// when all the WAL records going back to the cached image have been collected.
///
/// When get_value_reconstruct_data returns Complete, 'img' is set to an image
/// of the page, or the oldest WAL record in 'records' is a will_init-type
/// record that initializes the page without requiring a previous image.
///
/// If 'get_page_reconstruct_data' returns Continue, some 'records' may have
/// been collected, but there are more records outside the current layer. Pass
/// the same ValueReconstructState struct in the next 'get_value_reconstruct_data'
