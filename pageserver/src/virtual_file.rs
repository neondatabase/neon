//!
//! VirtualFile is like a normal File, but it's not bound directly to
//! a file descriptor. Instead, the file is opened when it's read from,
//! and if too many files are open globally in the system, least-recently
//! used ones are closed.
//!
//! To track which files have been recently used, we use the clock algorithm
//! with a 'recently_used' flag on each slot.
//!
//! This is similar to PostgreSQL's virtual file descriptor facility in
//! src/backend/storage/file/fd.c
