//! The validator is responsible for validating DeletionLists for execution,
//! based on whethe the generation in the DeletionList is still the latest
//! generation for a tenant.
//!
//! The purpose of validation is to ensure split-brain safety in the cluster
//! of pageservers: a deletion may only be executed if the tenant generation
//! that originated it is still current.  See docs/rfcs/025-generation-numbers.md
//! The purpose of accumulating lists before validating them is to reduce load
//! on the control plane API by issuing fewer, larger requests.
//!
//! In addition to validating DeletionLists, the validator validates updates to remote_consistent_lsn
//! for timelines: these are logically deletions because the safekeepers use remote_consistent_lsn
//! to decide when old
//!
//! Deletions are passed onward to the Deleter.
