//! This module provides various Pageserver gRPC client resource pools.
//!
//! These pools are designed to reuse gRPC resources (connections, clients, and streams) across
//! multiple concurrent callers (i.e. Postgres backends). This avoids the resource cost and latency
//! of creating dedicated TCP connections and server tasks for every Postgres backend.
//!
//! Each resource has its own, nested pool. The pools are custom-built for the properties of each
//! resource -- they are different enough that a generic pool isn't suitable.
//!
//! * ChannelPool: manages gRPC channels (TCP connections) to a single Pageserver. Multiple clients
//!   can acquire and use the same channel concurrently (via HTTP/2 stream multiplexing), up to a
//!   per-channel client limit. Channels may be closed when they are no longer used by any clients.
//!
//! * ClientPool: manages gRPC clients for a single tenant shard. Each client acquires a (shared)
//!   channel from the ChannelPool for the client's lifetime. A client can only be acquired by a
//!   single caller at a time, and is returned to the pool when dropped. Idle clients may be removed
//!   from the pool after some time, to free up the channel.
//!
//! * StreamPool: manages bidirectional gRPC GetPage streams. Each stream acquires a client from the
//!   ClientPool for the stream's lifetime. Internal streams are not exposed to callers; instead, it
//!   returns a guard that can be used to send a single request, to properly enforce queue depth and
//!   route responses. Internally, the pool will reuse or spin up a suitable stream for the request,
//!   possibly pipelining multiple requests from multiple callers on the same stream (up to some
//!   queue depth). Idle streams may be removed from the pool after a while to free up the client.
//!
//! Each channel corresponds to one TCP connection. Each client unary request and each stream
//! corresponds to one HTTP/2 stream and server task.
//!
//! TODO: error handling (including custom error types).
//! TODO: observability.
