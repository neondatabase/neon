//! This module provides various Pageserver gRPC client resource pools.
//!
//! These pools are designed to reuse gRPC resources (connections, clients, and streams) across
//! multiple concurrent callers (i.e. Postgres backends). This avoids the resource cost and latency
//! of creating dedicated TCP connections and server tasks for every Postgres backend.
//!
//! Each resource has its own, nested pool. The pools are custom-built for the properties of each
//! resource -- they are different enough that a generic pool isn't suitable.
//!
//! * ChannelPool: manages gRPC channels (TCP connections) to a single Pageserver. Multiple clients
//!   can acquire and use the same channel concurrently (via HTTP/2 stream multiplexing), up to a
//!   per-channel client limit. Channels are closed immediately when empty, and indirectly rely on
//!   client/stream idle timeouts.
//!
//! * ClientPool: manages gRPC clients for a single tenant shard. Each client acquires a (shared)
//!   channel from the ChannelPool for the client's lifetime. A client can only be acquired by a
//!   single caller at a time, and is returned to the pool when dropped. Idle clients are removed
//!   from the pool after a while to free up resources.
//!
//! * StreamPool: manages bidirectional gRPC GetPage streams. Each stream acquires a client from the
//!   ClientPool for the stream's lifetime. A stream can only be acquired by a single caller at a
//!   time, and is returned to the pool when dropped. Idle streams are removed from the pool after
//!   a while to free up resources.
//!
//!   The stream only supports sending a single, synchronous request at a time, and does not support
//!   pipelining multiple requests from different callers onto the same stream -- instead, we scale
//!   out concurrent streams to improve throughput. There are many reasons for this design choice:
//!
//!     * It (mostly) eliminates head-of-line blocking. A single stream is processed sequentially by
//!       a single server task, which may block e.g. on layer downloads, LSN waits, etc.
//!
//!     * Cancellation becomes trivial, by closing the stream. Otherwise, if a caller goes away
//!       (e.g. because of a timeout), the request would still be processed by the server and block
//!       requests behind it in the stream. It might even block its own timeout retry.
//!
//!     * Stream scheduling becomes significantly simpler and cheaper.
//!
//!     * Individual callers can still use client-side batching for pipelining.
//!
//!     * Idle streams are cheap. Benchmarks show that an idle GetPage stream takes up about 26 KB
//!       per stream (2.5 GB for 100,000 streams), so we can afford to scale out.
//!
//! Each channel corresponds to one TCP connection. Each client unary request and each stream
//! corresponds to one HTTP/2 stream and server task.
//!
//! TODO: error handling (including custom error types).
//! TODO: observability.
