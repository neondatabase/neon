## Page server architecture

The Page Server has a few different duties:

- Respond to GetPage@LSN requests from the Compute Nodes
- Receive WAL from WAL safekeeper
- Replay WAL that's applicable to the chunks that the Page Server maintains
- Backup to S3


The Page Server consists of multiple threads that operate on a shared
cache of page versions:


                                           | WAL
                                           V
                                   +--------------+
                                   |              |
                                   | WAL receiver |
                                   |              |
                                   +--------------+
                                                                                 +----+

--->   Data flow
<---


Page Service
------------

The Page Service listens for GetPage@LSN requests from the Compute Nodes,
and responds with pages from the page cache.


WAL Receiver
------------

The WAL receiver connects to the external WAL safekeeping service (or
directly to the primary) using PostgreSQL physical streaming
replication, and continuously receives WAL. It decodes the WAL records,
and stores them to the page cache repository.


Page Cache
----------

The Page Cache is a switchboard to access different Repositories.

#### Repository
Repository corresponds to one .zenith directory.
Repository is needed to manage Timelines.
Each repository has associated WAL redo service.

There is currently only one implementation of the Repository trait,
LayeredRepository, but it's still a useful abstraction that keeps the
interface for the low-level storage functionality clean. The layered
storage format is described in layered_repository/README.md.

#### Timeline
Timeline is a page cache workhorse that accepts page changes
and serves get_page_at_lsn() and get_rel_size() requests.
Note: this has nothing to do with PostgreSQL WAL timeline.

#### Branch
We can create branch at certain LSN.
Each Branch lives in a corresponding timeline and has an ancestor.

To get full snapshot of data at certain moment we need to traverse timeline and its ancestors.

#### WAL redo service
WAL redo service - service that runs PostgreSQL in a special wal_redo mode
to apply given WAL records over an old page image and return new page image.


TODO: Garbage Collection / Compaction
-------------------------------------

Periodically, the Garbage Collection / Compaction thread runs
and applies pending WAL records, and removes old page versions that
are no longer needed.


TODO: Backup service
--------------------

The backup service is responsible for periodically pushing the chunks to S3.

TODO: How/when do restore from S3? Whenever we get a GetPage@LSN request for
a chunk we don't currently have? Or when an external Control Plane tells us?

TODO: Sharding
--------------------

We should be able to run multiple Page Servers that handle sharded data.
