/*
 * Restore running-xact information by scanning the CLOG at startup.
 *
 * In PostgreSQL, a standby always has to wait for a running-xacts WAL record
 * to arrive before it can start accepting queries. Furthermore, if there are
 * transactions with too many subxids (> 64) open to fit in the in-memory
 * subxids cache, the running-xacts record will be marked as "suboverflowed",
 * and the standby will need to also wait for the currently in-progress
 * transactions to finish.
 *
 * That's not great in PostgreSQL, because a hot standby does not necessary
 * open up for queries immediately as you might expect. But it's worse in
 * Neon: A standby in Neon doesn't need to start WAL replay from a checkpoint
 * record; it can start at any LSN. Postgres arranges things so that there is
 * a running-xacts record soon after every checkpoint record, but when you
 * start from an arbitrary LSN, that doesn't help. If the primary is idle, or
 * not running at all, it might never write a new running-xacts record,
 * leaving the replica in a limbo where it can never start accepting queries.
 *
 * To mitigate that, we have an additional mechanism to find the running-xacts
 * information: we scan the CLOG, making note of any XIDs not marked as
 * committed or aborted. They are added to the Postgres known-assigned XIDs
 * array by calling ProcArrayApplyRecoveryInfo() in the caller of this
 * function.
 *
 * There is one big limitation with that mechanism: The size of the
 * known-assigned XIDs is limited, so if there are a lot of in-progress XIDs,
 * we have to give up. Furthermore, we don't know how many of the in-progress
 * XIDs are subtransactions, and if we use up all the space in the
 * known-assigned XIDs array for subtransactions, we might run out of space in
 * the array later during WAL replay, causing the replica to shut down with
 * "ERROR: too many KnownAssignedXids". The safe # of XIDs that we can add to
 * the known-assigned array without risking that error later is very low,
 * merely PGPROC_MAX_CACHED_SUBXIDS == 64, so we take our chances and use up
 * to half of the known-assigned XIDs array for the subtransactions, even
 * though that risks getting the error later.
 *
 * Note: It's OK if the recovered list of XIDs includes some transactions that
 * have crashed in the primary, and hence will never commit. They will be seen
 * as in-progress, until we see a new next running-acts record with an
 * oldestActiveXid that invalidates them. That's how the known-assigned XIDs
 * array always works.
 *
 * If scraping the CLOG doesn't succeed for some reason, like the subxid
 * overflow, Postgres will fall back to waiting for a running-xacts record
 * like usual.
 *
 * Returns true if a complete list of in-progress XIDs was scraped.
