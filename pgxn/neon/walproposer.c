 *
 * walproposer.c
 *
 * Proposer/leader part of the total order broadcast protocol between postgres
 * and WAL safekeepers.
 *
 * We have two ways of launching WalProposer:
 *
 *   1. As a background worker which will pretend to be physical WalSender.
 * 		WalProposer will receive notifications about new available WAL and
 * 		will immediately broadcast it to alive safekeepers.
 *
 *   2. As a standalone utility by running `postgres --sync-safekeepers`. That
 *      is needed to create LSN from which it is safe to start postgres. More
 *      specifically it addresses following problems:
 *
 *      a) Chicken-or-the-egg problem: compute postgres needs data directory
 *         with non-rel files that are downloaded from pageserver by calling
 *         basebackup@LSN. This LSN is not arbitrary, it must include all
 *         previously committed transactions and defined through consensus
 *         voting, which happens... in walproposer, a part of compute node.
 *
 *      b) Just warranting such LSN is not enough, we must also actually commit
 *         it and make sure there is a safekeeper who knows this LSN is
 *         committed so WAL before it can be streamed to pageserver -- otherwise
 *         basebackup will hang waiting for WAL. Advancing commit_lsn without
 *         playing consensus game is impossible, so speculative 'let's just poll
 *         safekeepers, learn start LSN of future epoch and run basebackup'
 *         won't work.
 *
 * Both ways are implemented in walproposer_pg.c file. This file contains
 * generic part of walproposer which can be used in both cases, but can also
 * be used as an independent library.
