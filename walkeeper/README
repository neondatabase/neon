# WAL safekeeper

Also know as the WAL service, WAL keeper or WAL acceptor.

The WAL safekeeper acts as a holding area and redistribution center
for recently generated WAL. The primary Postgres server streams the
WAL to the WAL safekeeper, and treats it like a (synchronous)
replica. A replication slot is used in the primary to prevent the
primary from discarding WAL that hasn't been streamed to the
safekeeper yet.

The primary connects to the WAL safekeeper, so it works in a "push"
fashion.  That's different from how streaming replication usually
works, where the replica initiates the connection. To do that, there
is a component called the "WAL proposer". The WAL proposer is a
background worker that runs in the primary Postgres server. It
connects to the WAL safekeeper, and
sends all the WAL. (PostgreSQL's archive_commands works in the
"push" style, but it operates on a WAL segment granularity. If
PostgreSQL had a push style API for streaming, WAL propose could be
implemented using it.)

The Page Server connects to the WAL safekeeper, using the same
streaming replication protocol that's used between Postgres primary
and standby. You can also connect the Page Server directly to a
primary PostgreSQL node for testing.

In a production installation, there are multiple WAL safekeepers
running on different nodes, and there is a quorum mechanism using the
Paxos algorithm to ensure that a piece of WAL is considered as durable
only after it has been flushed to disk on more than half of the WAL
safekeepers. The Paxos and crash recovery algorithm ensures that only
one primary node can be actively streaming WAL to the quorum of
safekeepers.


See vendor/postgres/src/bin/safekeeper/README.md for a more detailed
desription of the consensus protocol. (TODO: move the text here?)
