# Test two different scenarios related to gc of data needed by hot standby.
#
# When pause_apply is False, standby is mostly caught up with the primary.
# However, in compute <-> pageserver protocol version 1 only one LSN had been
# sent to the pageserver in page request, and to avoid waits in the pageserver
# it was last-written LSN cache value. If page hasn't been updated for a long
# time that resulted in an error from the pageserver: "Bad request: tried to
# request a page version that was garbage collected". For primary this wasn't a
# problem because pageserver always bumped LSN to the newest one; for standy
# that would be incorrect since we might get page fresher then apply LSN. Hence,
# in protocol version v2 two LSNs were introduced: main request_lsn (apply LSN
# in case of standby) and not_modified_since which could be used as an
# optimization to avoid waiting.
#
# https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/issues/6211
#
# When pause_apply is True we model standby lagging behind primary (e.g. due to
# high max_standby_streaming_delay). To prevent pageserver from removing data
# still needed by the standby apply LSN is propagated in standby -> safekeepers
# -> broker -> pageserver flow so that pageserver could hold off gc for it.
