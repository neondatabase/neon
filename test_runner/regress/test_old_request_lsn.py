# Test where Postgres generates a lot of WAL, and it's garbage collected away, but
# no pages are evicted so that Postgres uses an old LSN in a GetPage request.
# We had a bug where the page server failed to find the page version because it
# thought it was already garbage collected away, because the LSN in the GetPage
# request was very old and the WAL from that time was indeed already removed.
# In reality, the LSN on a GetPage request coming from a primary server is
# just a hint that the page hasn't been modified since that LSN, and the page
# server should return the latest page version regardless of the LSN.
