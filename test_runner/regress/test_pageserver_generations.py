"""

Tests in this module exercise the pageserver's behavior around generation numbers,
as defined in docs/rfcs/025-generation-numbers.md.  Briefly, the behaviors we require
of the pageserver are:
- Do not start a tenant without a generation number if control_plane_api is set
- Remote objects must be suffixed with generation
- Deletions may only be executed after validating generation
- Updates to remote_consistent_lsn may only be made visible after validating generation
