    Test that postgres was compiled with -fsigned-char.
    ---
    In multi-character keys, the GIN index creates a CRC Hash of the first 3 bytes of the key.
    The hash can have the first bit to be set or unset, needing to have a consistent representation
    of char across architectures for consistent results. GIN stores these keys by their hashes
    which determines the order in which the keys are obtained from the GIN index.
    Using -fsigned-char enforces this order across platforms making this consistent.
    The following query gets all the data present in the leaf page of a GIN index,
    which is ordered by the CRC hash and is consistent across platforms.
