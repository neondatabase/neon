    # support for setting the persistence of a table in 9.5. The reason that

    # 9.5) is that all the regression tests that deal with unlogged tables
    # up until that point dropped the unlogged tables or set them to logged
    # at some point during the test.
    #
    # In version 15, Postgres grew support for unlogged sequences, and with
    # that came a few more regression tests. These tests did not all drop
    # the unlogged tables/sequences prior to finishing.
    #
    # But unlogged sequences came with a bug in that, sequences didn't
    # inherit the persistence of their "parent" tables if they had one. This
    # was fixed and backported to 15, thus exacerbating our problem a bit.

    # So what we can do is just ignore file differences between the data
    # directory and basebackup for unlogged relations.
