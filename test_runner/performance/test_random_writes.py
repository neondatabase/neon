# This is a clear-box test that demonstrates the worst case scenario for the
# "1 segment per layer" implementation of the pageserver. It writes to random
# rows, while almost never writing to the same segment twice before flushing.
# A naive pageserver implementation would create a full image layer for each
# dirty segment, leading to write_amplification = segment_size / page_size,
# when compared to vanilla postgres. With segment_size = 10MB, that's 1250.
