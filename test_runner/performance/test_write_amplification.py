# Demonstrate Write Amplification with naive oldest-first layer checkpointing
# algorithm.
#
# In each iteration of the test, we create a new table that's slightly under 10
# MB in size (10 MB is the current "segment size" used by the page server). Then
# we make a tiny update to all the tables already created. This creates a WAL
# pattern where you have a lot of updates on one segment (the newly created
# one), alternating with a small updates on all relations. This is the worst
# case scenario for the naive checkpointing policy where we write out the layers
# in LSN order, writing the oldest layer first. That creates a new 10 MB image
# layer to be created for each of those small updates.  This is the Write
# Amplification problem at its finest.
